Subject: Request to Enable Trade/Deposit Permissions for Manager Account 900546

Dear Broker Support Team,

I am writing to request additional permissions for our MT5 Manager account to enable automated balance operations via the Web API.

**Current Situation:**
- Manager Account: 900546
- Server: 86.104.251.172:443 (Flexy Server)
- Current Status: Account creation via `/api/user/add` works perfectly
- Issue: Balance deposit operations via `/api/trade/balance` return "retcode 8: Not enough permissions"

**Request:**
Please enable the following permissions for Manager account 900546:
- **Trade Operations Permission** (PERM_m_trade or equivalent)
- Specifically, permission to execute balance deposit operations via the Web API endpoint `/api/trade/balance`

**Use Case:**
We are building an automated prop firm onboarding system that needs to:
1. Create challenge accounts (✅ Currently working)
2. Automatically deposit initial balance when customers purchase 2-phase challenges (❌ Currently blocked)

**Technical Details:**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/trade/balance?login=X&type=2&balance=X&comment=X`
- Current Response: `{ "retcode" : "8 Not enough permissions" }`
- Expected Response: `{ "retcode" : "0 Done", "answer" : { "Ticket" : "..." } }`

**Testing:**
Once permissions are granted, we will test with account #900556 to verify functionality.

Thank you for your assistance. Please let us know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Company]
